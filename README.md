# Team Sick Legends
Major Group Project SEG


Your software or each software component must include a README.md file.  This file must include the following:

    The title of the project and the name of the software.
    The names of all authors of the software.
    A list of all significant parts of the source code written by others that you employed directly or relied on heavily when writing this software and the locations of this source material.  Think of this as the "reference list" for your source code.
    The location where the software or software component is deployed and sufficient information to access it.  The latter includes access credentials for the different types of user who may employ the software.

Your README.md files may include other content if you wish.  For example, it may include a short description of the software and any other content you deem relevant.  This is not required, however.
